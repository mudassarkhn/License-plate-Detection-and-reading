## 📖 Introduction
This project implements a **real-time license plate detection and reading system** using computer vision and deep learning. It detects vehicles and their license plates from video feeds and performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the plate numbers. The system utilizes **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for object detection and **PaddleOCR** for text recognition.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🚙 Real-time vehicle detection
- 🏷️ License plate detection and localization
- 🔤 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for license plate text extraction
- 🖼️ Visual display of detected plates with:
  - Highlighted license plate regions
  - Extracted plate numbers
  - Cropped and enlarged plate images
- 🎥 Support for video file processing
- 🎨 Clean visualization with custom border drawing

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries (can be installed via `requirements.txt`)

---

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the required model files:
   - Place the license plate detection model in `Models/license_plate_model.pt`
   - Place the vehicle detection model in `Models/yolo11n.pt`

---

## ▶️ Usage
1. Place your input video in the `Testing Resources` directory.

2. Run the main script:
```bash
python Main_code_file.py
```

3. Controls:
   - Press **'q'** to quit the application.

## 📂 Output
The system will display:
- Real-time video feed with detected vehicles and license plates
- Bounding boxes around detected vehicles and license plates
- License plate numbers displayed above the detected plates
- Cropped and enlarged views of detected license plates
